  <h1>What If You Had Just 1 Year Left to Win in Life?</h1>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510070009289-b5bc34383727" alt="Clock and urgency">
  <p>What if the clock was ticking louder than you ever imagined?</p>
  <p>Imagine you had just 365 days left — not to survive, but to truly <strong>win</strong>.</p>
  <p>This is not a countdown to death — it's a countdown to <strong>legacy</strong>.</p>
  <p>When you think with urgency, you move with power. You stop caring what they think. You fight. You build. You rise in silence — and let your results make the noise.</p>
</section>

<section id="s2">
  <h2>Step 1: Wake Up to the Reality of Time</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534438327276-14e5300c3a48" alt="Sunrise alarm clock">
  <p>Most people act like they have forever. Truth is, time is borrowed — not guaranteed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>12 months = 365 chances</li>
    <li>8,760 hours to build or break your future</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Start today. There’s no “perfect moment” — only time slipping away.</p>
</section>

<section id="s3">
  <h2>Step 2: Define What Winning Means to You</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507525428034-b723cf961d3e" alt="Target success goal">
  <p>Is it money? Freedom? Peace? Don’t chase someone else’s dream. Define your version of success — then chase it like fire.</p>
</section>

<section id="s4">
  <h2>Step 3: Cut the Noise – Focus Only on What Matters</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519241047957-be31d7379a5d" alt="Focus and silence">
  <p>Social media, drama, distractions — all of them steal your future. Remove what’s not aligned with your vision. Time is oxygen. Don’t waste it on what doesn’t breathe life into you.</p>
</section>

<section id="s5">
  <h2>Step 4: Master the Power of Daily Discipline</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518972559570-0f49b74fdd33" alt="Checklist and discipline">
  <p>You don’t need motivation. You need rituals. Show up daily, even when it’s boring. Winners aren’t made in bursts — they’re made in repetition.</p>
</section>

<section id="s6">
  <h2>Step 5: Eliminate Fear & Self-Doubt</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499084732479-de2c02d45fc4" alt="Breaking fear">
  <p>Fear kills more dreams than failure. Don’t wait till you're ready — act now. Confidence is built through action, not overthinking.</p>
</section>

<section id="s7">
  <h2>Step 6: Build Ruthless Focus on Execution</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508780709619-79562169bc64" alt="Execution and sprint">
  <p>Reading books, watching videos — it's not enough. The real game is doing. Execution is the new intelligence. Take messy action — now.</p>
</section>

<section id="s8">
  <h2>Step 7: Keep Your Circle Clean and Small</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1500648767791-00dcc994a43e" alt="Strong friend circle">
  <p>Surround yourself with energy that fuels you. Protect your focus. One wrong voice can ruin your direction.</p>
</section>

<section id="s9">
  <h2>Step 8: Fail Fast, Learn Faster</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573164713988-8665fc963095" alt="Fail learn repeat">
  <p>Don’t aim to avoid failure — aim to <strong>learn quickly</strong>. Every L is a lesson. Winners collect lessons. Losers collect excuses.</p>
</section>

<section id="s10">
  <h2>Step 9: Live Loud, Die Empty</h2>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb" alt="Live fully">
  <p>Don’t die with dreams still inside you. Speak. Build. Try. Fall. Rise. Create. Live in a way where nothing is left unsaid, undone, or unlived.</p>
  <p><strong>This is your year.</strong> Make it legendary.</p>
